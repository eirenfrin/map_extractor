Boundaries will hold txts 
Each txt will contain boundaries coords collected manually from the map

Maps will hold folders of images
Each folder will contain screenshots representing tiles 

Each folder will have one corresponding txt with the same numerical code in the title
Each image will have absolute (pixel) coord and relative (to other images) coords in the title
