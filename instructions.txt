Boundaries will hold txts 
Each txt will contain boundaries coords collected manually from the map

Maps will hold folders of images
Each folder will contain screenshots representing tiles 

Each folder will have one corresponding txt with the same numerical code in the title
Each image will have absolute (pixel) coord and relative (to other images) coords in the title

boundaries capturer gets x y coords of the cursor, stores them in a file
tiles creator computes the exact screenshots locations


----------------------------------------
* automate screenshots
* boundaries collection mechanism
* divide into classes
* store coords x y of the boundaries
* divide area into equal tiles
* position screenshots according to tiles

asynch await alert notification?
convert cursor position to middle coords of the screenshot
find equation to connect pixel position to coords at given zoom level
